# WorldClim

Annual mean temperature & precipitation, and elevation were downloaded from [WorldClim](https://worldclim.org/). Slope was calculated from the elevation raster.

WorldClim bands used:

MAT = Mean annual temperature = BIO1
MAP = Mean annual precipitation = BIO12

Mean Values for 1970-2000
